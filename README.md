# Agentic AI Learning Journey

This repository documents my step-by-step learning of agentic AI concepts using Python.

I am rebuilding my skills by starting with simple rule-based agents and gradually moving toward real AI-powered agents.

## What is an Agent?
An agent is a program that:
1. Takes a goal
2. Decides what action to take
3. Performs the action
4. Returns a result

## Files in this Repository

- `agent_v1.py`  
  My first Python program. Used to verify Python installation and basic execution.

- `agent_v2.py`  
  A simple rule-based agent that follows:
  **Goal → Decide → Act → Result**

- `agent_v3.py`  
  An improved agent that also explains **why** it chose a particular action.

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
python agent_v2.py

python agent_v3.py

## Why this README is GOOD (so you’re confident)

It shows:
- You understand what an **agent** is
- You are learning **step by step**
- You can **explain your code**
- You are actively improving (not pretending to be an expert)

Recruiters and instructors like this style because it’s **honest and clear**.

## What NOT to do in README (important)
❌ Don’t claim expertise  
❌ Don’t write long theory  
❌ Don’t copy marketing language  

Simple > impressive.

When you’re done, reply with:
> **“README added”**

Tomorrow we’ll:
- connect your agent to a real AI model  
- and slowly move into true **agentic AI**

You’re doing this the *right* way.
